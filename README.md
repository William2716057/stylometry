# stylometry
A python script that performs text analysis on the US Federalist Papers written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay between 1787 and 1788.
It determines authorship by performing analysis on word patterns in their writings and then creating distribution plots of the results.
The plots display distributions of word length
